# CN_Project
We have implemented a basic proxy server which accepts and parses incoming requests from the clients and responds to requests accordingly whether the requested resource is present in cache or not.We then set up our Python development environment and began working on the core proxy functionalities. So far we have implemented a basic HTTP/HTTPS proxy that can accept connections, parse requests, forward them to target servers, and relay responses back to clients. Additional caching and optimization features are currently being worked on.
